# HuntTheWumpus

This game was developed by me for a course (ISA 681) during my Masters course at George Mason University. It is a simple game which deals with strategically moving around through tiles (5x5 matrix), and killing the monster (wumpus).

Rules for playing Hunt the Wumpus:

1.There are 3 hazards: 
    1.A bottomless pit (you will feel a breeze nearby).
    2.A colony of bats that will pick you up and drop you in a random space--including potentially deadly spaces (you will hear flapping nearby).
    3.A fearsome, hungry, and unbathed wumpus (you will smell it nearby).
2.The wumpus is heavy; bats cannot lift him.
3.The wumpus is covered in suckers; he won't fall down the bottomless pit.
4.Firing an arrow that misses the wumpus may cause it to move.
5.You have 5 wumpus-piercing arrows.
6.You may find an arrow dropped by a previous hunter.
